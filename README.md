# Virtual World Simulator with Swing GUI

This repository contains an application that simulates a virtual world using a graphical representation with the Swing library. for the OOP course. The simulator creates a two-dimensional grid of a customizable size that represents the virtual world. The world is populated with different forms of life, each with unique behaviors and characteristics.

The application utilizes Swing components such as buttons and menu elements to implement functions like advancing to the next turn and saving/loading the world state.


## Requirements (project is completed on 4 points)
- **3 points**:

    * Implementation of the game world and its visualization using Swing.
    * Implementation of all mandatory animal species.
    * Implementation of all plant species.
    * Implementation of the Human controlled by arrow keys.
    * Implementation of a special ability for the Human.
    * Implementation of saving and loading the virtual world state to/from a file.
- **4 points**:

    * Implementation of the ability to add organisms to the game world. Clicking on an empty cell should provide the option to add any existing organisms to that cell.
- **5 points**:

    * Implementation of an abstraction for the game world with two different implementations. One implementation simulates the world on a grid, while the other implementation simulates the world on a hexagonal board (similar to a board game).
